## Working of Food Classifier
A food classifier is a machine learning model that takes an image of food as input and predicts what type of food it is. It uses computer vision techniques to identify features and patterns in the image, and then maps these features to known food categories in its training data. The output is a predicted food class, which can be displayed to the user.
